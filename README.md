# RiskModel Development and Validation Framework

A comprehensive framework for developing, validating, and managing retail credit risk models in compliance with regulatory requirements. This project demonstrates expertise in statistical modeling, model validation techniques, and risk management practices used in the banking industry.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a model risk management framework for retail credit risk assessment at a financial institution, focusing on:

1. **Model Development**: Implementation of various risk models using statistical and machine learning techniques
2. **Model Validation**: Independent validation process following regulatory guidelines
3. **Stress Testing**: Assessment of model performance under adverse economic conditions
4. **Model Monitoring**: Ongoing tracking of model performance and data drift detection

This framework aligns with regulatory requirements for model risk management in banking, such as SR 11-7 (Fed), OCC 2011-12, and OSFI E-23 guidelines.

## How This Project Addresses Job Requirements

This project directly addresses the key requirements in the TD Bank Model Validation job description:

1. **Retail Credit Risk Model Validation**: Implements a complete validation framework for retail credit models including PPNR models
2. **Independent Benchmarking**: Develops benchmark models for comparison during validation
3. **Model Assessment**: Evaluates model appropriateness, assumptions, and implementation
4. **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive validation reports with findings and recommendations
5. **Statistical Analysis**: Applies advanced statistical techniques to model validation
6. **Programming Skills**: Demonstrates proficiency in Python, including statistical libraries and visualization tools
7. **Retail Banking Knowledge**: Incorporates domain knowledge of credit risk management and customer behaviors
8. **Documentation**: Creates detailed technical documentation and management summaries

## Key Features

- Python-based implementation of credit risk models
- Statistical validation techniques in compliance with regulatory guidelines
