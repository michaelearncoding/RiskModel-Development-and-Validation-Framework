# RiskModel Development and Validation Framework

A comprehensive framework for developing, validating, and managing retail credit risk models in compliance with regulatory requirements. This project demonstrates expertise in statistical modeling, model validation techniques, and risk management practices used in the banking industry.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a model development and validation process for retail credit risk assessment at a financial institution. It includes:

1. **Data Processing Module**: Techniques for handling, cleaning, and preprocessing credit data
2. **Model Development**: Implementation of various risk models (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, neural networks)
3. **Model Validation Framework**: Independent validation process including:
   - Statistical performance assessment
   - Model stability testing
   - Sensitivity analysis
   - Benchmarking against alternative models
   - Out-of-time validation
4. **Documentation**: Templates for model documentation and validation reports
5. **Governance**: Model risk management workflow and approval process

## Key Features

- Python-based implementation of credit risk models
- Statistical validation techniques in compliance with regulatory guidelines
- Stress testing capabilities for various economic scenarios
- AML risk detection components
- Model performance monitoring dashboards
- Comprehensive documentation and reporting templates
